<h1>Why Sapiens?</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>There are lots of other books.</li>
		<li>I believe Harari's doesn't know that the field of Sociology exists.</li>
		<li>Additionally, I don't think Harari understands what academia is in general.</li>
		<li>If you have even a shallow knowledge of any of the subjects he covers, it will be obvious he has no idea what he's talking about.</li>
		<li>There are so many good and cool books out there, please go read one of those.</li>
	</ul>

<h1>Scholarly reviews of Sapiens</h1>
<blockquote>
	<p>"The book is fundamentally unserious and undeserving of the wide acclaim and attention it has been receiving"
	</p>
	<cite>John Sexton</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p>"...whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new, and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong, sometimes seriously"</p>
	<cite>Christopher Robert Hallpike</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p>"There's a whiff of dorm-room bull sessions about the author's stimulating but often unsourced assertions."</p>
	<cite>Charles C. Mann</cite>
