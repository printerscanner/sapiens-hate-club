	<h1>Why does Sapiens suck?</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Harari has no idea what he's talking about with any of the topics he covers.</li>
			<li>This book fundamentally misunderstands science.</li>
			<li>There are so many good books out there, please go read one of those.</li>
			<li>I'm sick of seeing this book on bookshelves. It's been 10 YEARS.</li>
